OPEN HASHING (Separate Chaining)
- Also known as separate chaining
- Each table index stores a linked list of elements
- All collided keys are stored in the same chain
- Hash function determines the index only
- No probing is required
- Deletion is simple and does not affect other keys
- Performance depends on chain length
