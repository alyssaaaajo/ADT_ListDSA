Closed hashing, also known as open addressing, is a hashing technique in which all keys are stored directly inside the hash table. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for another available slot within the table using a probing method such as linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing. No additional memory structures are used for collision handling. Deletion is managed using a special marker to maintain correct search behavior. As the table becomes more occupied, performance decreases due to longer probe sequences.

<h1>LINEAR HASHING (Linear Probing)</h1>

Closed hashing technique

Resolves collisions by checking the next sequential slot

Table is treated as circular

Uses a DELETED marker for removals

Prone to primary clustering

BUCKET HASHING

Hash table is divided into fixed-size buckets

Each bucket represents a range of indices

Keys are stored within the bucket range

Collision handling is limited to the bucket

Bucket overflow occurs when the bucket is full

PROGRESSIVE OVERFLOW

Hash table is divided into primary and secondary areas

Primary area stores elements using the hash function

Collisions are handled using linked overflow nodes

Overflow space is allocated progressively

Reduces clustering but requires pointer management
